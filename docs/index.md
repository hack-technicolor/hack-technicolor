## Where to Start

We conventionally define different firmware *Types* to make different paths easier to follow. Determine your current firmware version and find out which *Type* it is by using the [Firmware Repository](Firmware%20Repository/).

!!! hint "Can't find your firmware?"
    Determining your current version number is not always an easy task, make sure you read the correct one. Very old firmware's from the Homeware 10.x era and older versions are outside the scope of this wiki. Despite the existence of old "*unlocking*" guides, if newer "*rootable*" firmware exists for such gateways, they can be upgraded following the same steps as `Type ???`. Also, consider any other newer not yet listed firmwareâ€™s as `Type ???`.

If your gateway firmware is:

- Type 1 is not directly rootable so load Type 2 then root other bank containing Type 1
    - See [Hack Type 1 and 2](Hack%20Type%201&2/) for detailed guide

- Type 2 directly rootable
    - See [Hack Type 1 and 2](Hack%20Type%201&2/) for detailed guide

- Type 3 has more complicated process to load Type 2
    - See [BOOTP flashing](Recovery/#bootp-flashing) and [Bootfail Procedure](Recovery/#bootfail-procedure)

- Type ??? is unknown
    - Try the same as for Type 2, follow Type 3 steps otherwise

See the [README](https://github.com/kevdagoat/hack-technicolor/blob/master/README.md) for more info about what are *Types*.
