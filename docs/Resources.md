## IMPORTANT, do not SKIP

**Warning:** This process is not supported by the manufacturer or supplier of your Gateway.

There is no way of knowing your situation and the process could break your Gateway or reduce its security allowing other people into your network. Anyone following this guide accepts full responsibility for the outcomes.

## The flash layout

Here is how the Homeware flash layout typically looks like on newer ARM boards:

`root@mygateway:~# cat /proc/mtd`

| Device | Size       | Erasesize   | Name         |
|:-------|:-----------|:------------|:-------------|
| `mtd0` | `10000000` | `00020000`  | `brcmnand.0` |
| `mtd1` | `02c60000` | `00020000`  | `rootfs`     |
| `mtd2` | `05920000` | `00020000`  | `rootfs_data`|
| `mtd3` | `05000000` | `00020000`  | `bank_1`     |
| `mtd4` | `05000000` | `00020000`  | `bank_2`     |
| `mtd5` | `00020000` | `00020000`  | `eripv2`     |
| `mtd6` | `00040000` | `00020000`  | `rawstorage` |

Apart from partition sizes and older MIPS boards where `mtd2` is `userfs` instead, the above layout is *usually* always the same.
It may change for newer gateways in future.

These gateways reserve two flash partitions (`bank_1` and `bank_2`) to store firmwares, which can be upgraded/used almost independently. The two banks contain read-only squashfs filesystem images, and that one being booted gets mounted as root `/`. They are digitally signed and the boot loader performs signature checking before boot, so you can't flip a single bit in the firmware image in either bank if you want to see your device booting. You may want to learn more about which bank is used by [different methods of flashing firmwares](#different-methods-of-flashing-firmwares) and which one will be the [booted bank](../Recovery/#change-booted-bank).

The `rootfs_data` (formerly `userfs`) partition holds whatever file change (config and customized stuff) or deletion you perform on either of both firmwares. It gets formatted as JFFS2 filesystem on boot when it appears as empty. Such filesystem gets mounted into `/overlay` and is used for storing two folders, each named as the firmware bank it relates (i.e. `/overlay/bank_1` and `/overlay/bank_2`). Their contents get applied on top of read-only firmwares banks as an [overlay filesystem](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt). The booted read-only image is also mounted into `/rom` and remains available after overlay is applied.

!!! hint
    You can directly access `/overlay` folder in case you want to backup stuff or revert some change you made. Every change made to the root filesystem will immediately appear in there. Remember, original versions of modified file are permanently available from `/rom`, in case you would like to compare.

When a proper [Reset to Factory Defaults (RTFD)](../Recovery/#reset-to-factory-defaults-rtfd) is done, the overlay partition is not formatted, the only relevant `/overlay/bank_*` folder is deleted instead. You can learn more on such aspects by reading the [Recovery](../Recovery/) page.

## The boot process

There exist many versions of this bootloader stack. Here we describe one from a VBNT-O (ARM) board. Actual addresses or unpacking code may differ between board versions, still what you read here is quite general.

There are 4 different stages involved in the boot process:
`boot0`: BootROM (BTRM v1.6) - to be dumped

Boot memory is mapped to `0x80700000` with the following layout

| Load Address | Offset | Name  |
| :------ | :------| :------ |
| `0x80700000` | - | `boot0` - BootRom (mapped from ROM) |
| `0x80710000` | `0x10000` | `boot1-factory` |
| `0x80710000` | `0x20000` | `boot1-secure` |
| `0x00f00000` | `0x60000` | `boot2` (main loader) |
| - | `0x80000` | unknown |

### boot0

`boot0` is a mask ROM embedded in the CPU
Its job is to initialize the system and load the next stage.
The next stage is apparently chosen depending on the secure boot state (it's unverified, tho)

* no secure boot: `boot1-factory`
* secure boot: `boot1-secure`

While booting the next stage, `boot0` makes available the BEK and the MCV key starting from address `0x8073F000`
Both the ROM and the BEK/MCV keys are wiped at the end of the boot process, and are thus inaccessible from the OS.

### boot1-factory

`boot1` variant that is ran only once, in factory
it's job is to burn the Market ID and the Secure Boot configuration in the CPU.
once it has ran, the system won't accept unsigned software anymore

### boot1-secure

`boot1` variant that is ran once secure boot has been enabled
it's signed and verified by BootROM

It can be interrupted by holding '`a`' on the UART console while booting up
This allows to enter the CFE ABORT menu with the following options

* c  - continue
* s  - DDR safe mode

No other option is available

It initializes the DDR memory, decompresses `boot2`, verifies it, and jumps to it

### boot2

`boot2` is compressed with LZMA. It's decompressed by `boot1` and ran at `0x00f00000`
`boot2` contains a factory menu that is ran in factory by sending a special DHCP/BOOTP packet while booting.
Once started, the menu awaits for commands on UDP port `11138`.

#### DHCP packet structure

The dhcp packet must contain vendor specific options (id 43)
Encoding seems similar to rfc1048, with the addition of a header

Values in Big Endian order

| Offset | Size | Description |
| :------ | :------| :------ |
| 0 | 2 | Magic (0x5354 or 'ST') |
| 2 | 1 | Body length (without header magic) |
| 3 | * | Options (rfc1048 encoding: u8 code, u8 length, ...data) |

Options table (by code)
Size excludes code and size fields

| Code | Size | Description |
| :------ | :------| :------ |
| `0x1`  | 1  | must hold the value `0xD5` for the menu to spawn |
| `0x2`  | 2  | must hold the value `63381` (`0xF795`) for the menu to spawn |
| `0x3`  | 4  | unknown |

I couldn't get the menu to appear yet.
TODO: verify if the menu is accessible, or if it's locked out once out of factory

Commands available within this menu regard the device lock-down and don't seem to allow arbitrary code execution

#### Known commands

| Command | Description |
| :------ | :------|
| I | Print Device Information |
| N | unknown |
| T 5 | Program Chip ID and JTAG Password |
| T 6 | Flash Factory Date |
| T 8 | Fuse JTAG and OTP locks |
| T 9 | Flash RIP2 image |
| X | Exit from menu |

Since `boot2` is derived from CFE, it holds some of the code that would handle the CFE command line menu, and has the string "`CFE> `" included in the binary.
However, the code to spawn the shell seems to be removed. It's as such impossible to enter the CFE shell

### Bootloader unlocking

`boot2` can be unlocked to load unsigned linux kernels. However, this requires a signed `RIP_ID_UNLOCK_TAG` to be present in the RIP storage. Such tag is valid only for the specific device it was issued for as it's based on some device-unique parameters such as the S/N and Chip ID, and must be issued by Technicolor.

Device specific parameters can be obtained from

* `/proc/efu`
* `/proc/otp`

### JTAG unlocking

JTAG seems to be enabled by `boot2` when there's no software to boot, to allow recovery of bricked devices
Unlocking JTAG is accomplished by writing `0x2` to the JTAG/OTP register `0xFFFEB614`

TODO: verify if JTAG is accessible

## Administering OpenWRT

### From Windows

There are a number of tools such as cmder, SmarTTY, PuTTY, and WinSCP as described in the [OpenWRT SSH Administration for Newcomers](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-quick-start/sshadministration) page.

### From Linux

As a Linux user, you're supposed to know how administer another Linux machine via SSH.

## Handy commands

Check firmware flashed and what is active:

* `find /proc/banktable -type f -print -exec cat {} ';'`

Show processes that are running:

* `ps`

Show programs that are listening as network services:

* `netstat -tuplen`

Show everything that's listening on sockets (TCP, UPD, Unix etc):

* `netstat -lenp`

Free (NAND) space:

* `df -h`

Dump entire config (~7700+ lines to console):

* `uci show`

Example to filter lines with password:

* `uci show | grep password`

Access logs for most services (which use syslog):

* `logread -f`

Access logs for most services (which use syslog). Pass an argument of `-e nginx` to match log entries just related to Nginx, which is perfect for debugging errors in the Web GUI. Pass an argument of `-e nginx` to match log entries just related to Nginx, which is perfect for debugging errors in the Web GUI. Remove `-f` flag for all time logs (erased every reboot).

Display status of all init.d scripts:

* `for F in /etc/init.d/* ; do $F enabled && echo $F on || echo $F **disabled**; done`

Switch active bank and reboot - **UNSAFE**:

* `/rom/usr/lib/cwmpd/transfers/switchover.sh`

Set `bank_1` as active, replace with `bank_2` for the opposite:

* `echo bank_1 > /proc/banktable/active`

OpenWrt Release metadata:

* `cat /etc/openwrt_release`

eg, from VANT-F:

```bash
DISTRIB_ID='OpenWrt'
DISTRIB_RELEASE='Chaos Calmer'
DISTRIB_REVISION='r46610'
DISTRIB_CODENAME='chaos_calmer'
DISTRIB_TARGET='brcm63xx-tch/VANTF'
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION='OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05.1'
DISTRIB_TAINTS='no-all busybox'
```

## Notable files

Lua/HTML Web Interface source files:

* `/www/*`

UCI config source files, pehaps more readable than `uci show`:

* `/etc/config/*`

Various executables, many custom-written for this hardware:

* `/sbin/*.sh, /usr/bin/*.sh, /usr/sbin/*.sh`

Services present; May or may not be enabled or running:

* `/etc/init.d/*`

## Different methods of flashing firmware's

Depending on the situation, you are usually asked to perform firmware flashing in different ways. Here is a short summary of them and some background details to better understand the big picture.

You can get a firmware image flashed by using one of the following modes:

|     Mode                 |                 Pros                               |                 Cons                                       |
|:-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bootloader Recovery      | Always available unless bootloader has been nuked  | No Bank switch occurs                                      |
| Direct Partition Writing | Can use bank dumps as well as RBI's                | No Bank switch occurs and the process requires root access |
| Sysupgrade Command       | Bank switch occurs and so does a basic factory reset | Process requires root access                             |

### Mode step outline

#### Bootloader recovery

* Loads RBI firmware images using BOOTP flashing.
* The firmware is transferred to the gateway via TFTP from your PC.
* RBI file is decrypted, unpacked and, if signature check passed, flashed into the `bank_1` partition then marked as correctly flashed.

#### Direct partition writing

* The firmware is usually transferred to the gateway temp filesystem via SSH/SCP or USB drive.
* The firmware image is directly written to the bank you specify on the command line.
* This flashing method requires root access to a booted firmware.

#### Sysupgrade

* The firmware is transferred to the gateway in various ways (WebUI, CWMP, SSH/SCP, USB, ...).
* RBI firmware is decrypted, unpacked, validated, simultaneously signature checked and flashed into the `inactive` bank partition and marked as correctly flashed.
* If all checks pass, a switchover is done, which means the active bank is switched and some operations on config like validation and migration is attempted.
* This flashing method is suited for firmware upgrades only, may not allow or correctly handle downgrades.
* This flashing method availability depends on a lot of different things, including firmware version and ISP's customisation, of course it requires a working booted firmware and it's always available if you have root access.
* Sysupgrade scripts are based on the original OpenWrt implementation with RBI, dual-bank, and switchover support implemented by Technicolor.
* Sysupgrade and switchover scripts may have been patched by a custom mod you installed to behave differently.
* AutoFlashGUI exploits this flashing method.

## Decrypting firmware

Firmware RBI files are easily decrypted using [Decrypt_RBI_Firmware_Utility](https://github.com/Ansuel/Decrypt_RBI_Firmware_Utility/releases) on any platform (Java Required). If you cannot find your OSCK and your device is rooted, then extract it and [share it](https://github.com/kevdagoat/hack-technicolor/upload/master/osck). See [secr](https://github.com/pedro-n-rocha/secr) tools for further details about keys usage and extraction.

## Backup/restore bit-for-bit dumps

This guide will show you how to dump a bit-for-bit clone of any partition and reflash it.

!!! info "Decrypted RBI v.s. bank dumps"
    Decrypted RBI firmwares are the same as `bank_1` or `bank_2` dumps except for their first four bytes. A correctly decrypted RBI starts with a sequence of four `0xFF`. You can edit these bytes to `0x00` and use the resulting file as a bank dump to be restored.

### You will need

* FAT32 USB Stick
* 5min

### Making dumps

`bank_1` is usually mapped to the `mtd3` partition and `bank_2` is usually mapped to `mtd4`, you do not really need to backup firmware banks if you already have an RBI file for that same firmware available.

If you are not sure you already have the same firmware saved somewhere, you can extract the RBI file, mark the first 4 bytes of the resulting binary to 0x00 and compare its checksum against output of `md5sum /dev/mtd*` (this may take a while to compute, be patient).

You definitely need instead to backup all other partitions, especially the `eripv2` one, and all the others. You can get the full partition list with `cat /proc/mtd`

It is good practice to keep moving dumped partitions to USB as soon as you complete one in order to minimise the chance of filling the ram, and causing an out-of-memory crash and reboot.

1. Plug in a USB stick and run:

```bash
ls -la /mnt/usb
```

Example output:

```bash
root@mygateway:~# ls -la /mnt/usb/
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root             0 Jan 16 12:31 .
drwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             0 Jan 16 10:55 ..
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            20 Jan 16 12:31 USB-A1 -> /tmp/run/mountd/sda1
```

1. To backup, run: `dd if=/dev/mtd<X> of=/tmp/mtd<X>.dump`.

    * Replace `<X>` with any block device number.

2. Move the dumped partition into USB drive, run: `mv /tmp/mtdX.dump /mnt/usb/<usb-path>/`.

    * Replace `<usb-path>` with your USB drive, see Step 1.

3. If `<X>` partition does not include any flash portion currently mounted with enabled write access, make sure to compare checksums to ensure the dump is a 1:1 exact copy.

4. Repeat from Step 1 for every partition you would like to dump.

### Restoring dumps

To restore a partition dump, run: `mtd write /mnt/usb/<usb-path>/mtd<X>.dump <partition_name>`

* Replace `<usb-path>` with your USB drive path

* Replace `<X>` with the block number

* Replace `<partition_name>` with the partition name you want to flash to (names are shown in `/proc/mtd` too)

Raw firmware dumps (which are not RBI files) are flashed this way to matching devices.

## Backing up configuration

Your a Super Modder. You flash your Gateway on a daily basis.

Backing up your current state it's all about backing up overlay contents. Keep in mind that copying overlay folder's content is not as effective as a bit-for-bit overlay partition (`mtd2`) backup: you will loose any deletion or renaming. However this is good enough in most cases.

Use the command below to manually create an archive with all your modified files from both firmware banks:

```bash
tar -C /overlay -cz -f /tmp/overlay-files-backup-$(date -I).tar.gz bank_1 bank_2
```

If you prefer, you can rely on `sysupgrade` to achieve a similar result for the booted bank only.

To save the Config:

```bash
sysupgrade -i -b /tmp/sysupgrade-backup-$(date -I).tar.gz
```

To restore the Config:

```bash
sysupgrade -f /tmp/sysupgrade-backup-*.tar.gz
```

## LED's management

[Directly accessing /sys/class/leds is a BAD practice...](https://github.com/davidjb/technicolor-tg799vac-hacks/issues/6#issue-388905312)

* `ls -1 /sys/class/leds/`
  * List available LED's.

* `cat /sys/class/leds/<led>:<colour>/trigger`
  * Shows the triggers available and the current trigger.
  * Replace LED with the name of the LED and colour with the colour, eg. `cat /sys/class/leds/dect:green/trigger`

* `echo "default-on" > /sys/class/leds/power:green/trigger`
  * Reset trigger to default.

* `opkg list | grep led`
  * List all LED packages used.

Examples:

Turn on LED:

```bash
echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/power:green/brightness
```

Turn off LED:

```bash
echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/power:red/brightness
```

## IPv6 issues

IPv6 is very problematic in most "TCH" Wrt builds (Homeware). The old OpenWRT version used by Technicolor to build Homeware (Chaos Calmer) has broken IPv6 Support. It also depends on the ISP's configuration. [See more.](https://github.com/Ansuel/tch-nginx-gui/issues/114)

## BusyBox (ash)

The gateway runs [BusyBox](https://busybox.net/about.html) as it's terminal emulator, designed for Embedded Linux systems.

```bash
root@mygateway:~# busybox --help
