# Safe Firmware Upgrade

This simple guide will show you how to clean-up your rooted Gateway modifications and safely change firmware avoiding or handling any possible issues, as well as preserving existing root access. If your Gateway is not rooted already or you don't know what *rooting* is about, go to [Home page](../).

This is the way you should regularly clean-up your modifications and install firmware upgrades when available. Firmware flashing via *sysupgrade* or *BOOTP* is not safe as it will remove root access.

This method will use direct partition writing to flash the firmware exactly where it needs to be and to guarantee root. Read [here](../Resources/#different-methods-of-flashing-firmwares) for extra details about different flashing methods.

## Get prepared

What you will need:

1. A rooted Gateway in working order

2. Make sure you can eventually get a copy of your current firmware
    - Check if it's available from [Firmware Repository](../Repository/)

3. A way to access this documentation in case of issues
    - If this is your main Gateway, a mobile internet connection is recommended

4. Your current bank planning. Check and take note of firmware flashed, *active* and *booted* banks after running:
`find /proc/banktable -type f -print -exec cat {} ';'`

5. The firmware image to flash, either RBI file or raw bank dump
    - Pick one for your model, of whatever *Type*, from the [Firmware Repository](../Repository/)

## Things to know

Will root access be preserved?
  - Well, that is the point of this guide, however we can't guarantee root access preservation won't break in future firmwares.

On which bank will the new firmware be flashed?
  - The booted one, the currently installed firmware will be overwritten. Make sure it is listed in our [Repository](../Repository/) before overwriting!

Will the upgrade affect my bank planning?
  - No it won't, there won't be any bank switches.

Will any setting and customization be lost?
  - It depends on the firmware you want to flash and how much you would like to be *safe*, read further.

!!! danger "Risky exception: Missing *Type 2* RBI"
    In the unfortunate case that there are no *Type 2* RBI firmware files available for your model, you are not in a safe position. If something goes wrong with this guide, using `BOOTP` recovery with *non-Type  2* images will bring you into a working unrootable firmware. In such a situation, upgrading is not recommended. Let expert users test this guide on that new firmware first.

## Preparing Firmware

Check the file format your new firmware is. It could be either an RBI file or a raw bank dump.

### RBI file

Take the RBI file to flash and move it to `/tmp/new.rbi` by SCP. Here is an example from WinSCP, but you can use any SCP client.

![WinSCP firmware upload](../images/winscp_upload.png)

Run this command to unpack the RBI image, will take a while:

```bash
cat "/tmp/new.rbi" | (bli_parser && echo "Please wait..." && (bli_unseal | dd bs=4 skip=1 seek=1 of="/tmp/new.bin"))
```

!!! fail "Something went wrong?"
    If the above command causes the gateway to reboot, use an USB drive instead. Move the RBI file into the USB drive and use its mount path in place of `/tmp`. Read [issue #128](https://github.com/hack-technicolor/hack-technicolor/issues/128) for more details. This is usually needed when there is not enough free RAM to perform firmware unpacking in memory.

### Raw bank dump

Download **and extract** the raw bank image, and move this file into `/tmp/new.bin` folder by SCP or USB drive.

## Clean-up

It is **recommended** to clean-up every changes to files and configs whenever you are either downgrading or moving to a firmware of a different brand.

If you are just flashing a minor firmware update of the same brand, you could take the short (and **unsafe**) path by skipping over to [Flashing firmware](#flashing-firmware). Please note, if anything goes wrong or you experience any issues, this will almost certainly be the culprit.

Make a full backup of your old firmware overlay:

```bash
tar -C /overlay -cz -f /tmp/backup-$(date -I).tar.gz $(cat /proc/banktable/booted)
```

Move the backup to your PC by SCP or USB drive. Make sure you can open the backup archive and keep it in a safe place.
Please note, importing back this full backup on the new firmware is dangerous. This will come handy in future whenever you go back to the old firmware, or if you want to check how the old firmware was configured.

Run the command below to completely reset the overlay for your currently booted bank:

```bash
rm -rf /overlay/$(cat /proc/banktable/booted)
```

The above command cleans up the same files a regular RTFD would. We need to prepare a couple more things before rebooting, that's why we didn't use RTFD.

!!! warning "Don't stop here!"
    Your gateway's booted bank is now completely **clean** and reset to factory defaults, right now there is no more ssh root access enabled!. You should **really** keep the getaway on and proceed to the next step to avoid loosing root access.

## Preserving root access

The below block of commands prepares a run-once root access setup script to be executed on the *next* boot. This is equivalent to redoing the entire hacking [from scratch](../) as if your gateway were never rooted before.

Run the following set of commands:

> *please note there is a long multi-line command here, paste it all at once*

```bash
mkdir -p /overlay/$(cat /proc/banktable/booted)/etc
chmod 755 /overlay/$(cat /proc/banktable/booted) /overlay/$(cat /proc/banktable/booted)/etc
echo -e "echo root:root | chpasswd
sed -i 's#/root:.*\$#/root:/bin/ash#' /etc/passwd
sed -i -e 's/#//' -e 's#askconsole:.*\$#askconsole:/bin/ash#' /etc/inittab
uci -q set \$(uci show firewall | grep -m 1 \$(fw3 -q print | \
egrep 'iptables -t filter -A zone_lan_input -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -m comment --comment \"!fw3: .+\" -j DROP' | \
sed -n -e 's/^iptables.\+fw3: \(.\+\)\".\+/\1/p') | \
sed -n -e \"s/\(.\+\).name='.\+'$/\1/p\").target='ACCEPT'
uci add dropbear dropbear
uci rename dropbear.@dropbear[-1]=afg
uci set dropbear.afg.enable='1'
uci set dropbear.afg.Interface='lan'
uci set dropbear.afg.Port='22'
uci set dropbear.afg.IdleTimeout='600'
uci set dropbear.afg.PasswordAuth='on'
uci set dropbear.afg.RootPasswordAuth='on'
uci set dropbear.afg.RootLogin='1'
uci set dropbear.lan.enable='0'
uci commit dropbear
/etc/init.d/dropbear enable
/etc/init.d/dropbear restart
rm /overlay/\$(cat /proc/banktable/booted)/etc/rc.local
source /rom/etc/rc.local
" > /overlay/$(cat /proc/banktable/booted)/etc/rc.local
chmod +x /overlay/$(cat /proc/banktable/booted)/etc/rc.local
sync

```

!!! hint "Clean and rooted"
    Your gateway is now clean but will re-enable permanent root SSH access on the next boot. Please note, your SSH credentials will be changed back to `root:root`. **Do not reboot** the gateway and move on to the next section where you will finally flash the new firmware image.

## Flashing firmware

Run these commands to write `/tmp/new.bin` image into `booted` bank and reboot soon after:

```bash
# Erase and write new firmware into booted bank
mtd -e $(cat /proc/banktable/booted) write "/tmp/new.bin" $(cat /proc/banktable/booted)
# Emulate system crash to hard reboot
echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger

```

The last command above will intentionally make the Gateway to crash. Wait for it to reboot completely.

## Completing setup

The Gateway should boot normally into the new firmware. Please review the following:

- Your bank plan hasn't been modified. If you are not sure the current bank plan is optimal, follow [Bank Planning](../Hacking/PostRoot/#bank-planning) instructions.
- You should still have permanent SSH server on port `22`.
- Your root credentials have been reset to `root:root`. MAke sure you [change password](../Hacking/PostRoot/#change-the-root-password) now.

!!! fail "Something went wrong?"
    BOOTP usually allows you to recover in case of boot failure caused by bad firmware flashing. Chances of successful recovery are greater if you were on optimal bank plan. Please, use the same `Type 2` firmware you had on `bank_1` during root, we assume you remember which one it was since we asked you to take note. Otherwise, use another `Type 2` one and cross your fingers. You will need to follow the rooting guide from scratch.
